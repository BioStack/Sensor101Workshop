# Sensors 101 workshop

A simple introduction to data reading and analysis of bio sensors.

### 1. Choose your sensor station

* Station 1-2: Microsoft Band 2 (EDA)
* Station 3: Touch Mouse (Stress pressure)
* Station 4: Neurosky (EEG)
* Station 5: Eyetracking Tobi
* Station 6: Zephyr (Heart)

### 2. Setup the sensor.

Read the instructions for the sensors:

* [Microsoft Band 2](https://github.com/BioStack/Sensors101/blob/master/Sensors/Band2.md)
* [Touch Mouse](https://github.com/BioStack/Sensors101/blob/master/Sensors/TouchMouse.md)
* [Neurosky Mindwave EEG](https://github.com/BioStack/Sensors101/blob/master/Sensors/MindWave-EEG.md)
* [Eyetracking Tobi]() <- Andy instructions needed.
* [Zephyr](https://github.com/BioStack/Sensors101/blob/master/Sensors/Zephyr.md)

### 3. Record data from a few people.

To establish a baseline. Watch these fun videos for 2-4 minutes.

* [Fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngLbnN3gCi8&feature=youtu.be)
* [Llama](https://youtu.be/Al5FUnQ65vQ)

To collect data for a programming task, try identifying the error in the following code snippet -- in 3 minutes:

* [Task 1](https://github.com/BioStack/Sensors101/blob/master/Tasks/SortingFunctions2.cs)
* [Task 2](https://github.com/BioStack/Sensors101/blob/master/Tasks/SortingFunctions2.cs)

### 4. Load the data

All data will export to a csv file. A sample of data for each sensor can be found in [Data](https://github.com/BioStack/Sensors101/tree/master/Data).

### Plot and Analyze data

Within RStudio, you can first run [sample code](https://github.com/BioStack/Sensors101/tree/master/Analysis) to execute code snippets.

Now that you've recorded some data and you want to see it, follow one of the following walkthroughs:

* [EDA](https://github.com/BioStack/Sensors101/blob/master/Analysis/README.md#eda)
* [EEG](https://github.com/BioStack/Sensors101/blob/master/Analysis/README.md#eeg)
* [Heart](https://github.com/BioStack/Sensors101/blob/master/Analysis/README.md#heart)
* [Touch Mouse](https://github.com/BioStack/Sensors101/blob/master/Analysis/README.md#touch)

For the Eyetracking sensor, we'll just watch a playback of tracking session.
