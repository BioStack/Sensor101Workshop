# Sensors 101 workshop

A simple introduction to data reading and analysis of bio sensors.

### 1. Choose your sensor station

* Station 1-2: Microsoft Band 2 (EDA)
* Station 3: Touch Mouse (Stress pressure)
* Station 4: Neurosky (EEG)
* Station 5: Eyetracking Tobi
* Station 6: Zephyr (Heart)

### 2. Setup the sensor.

Read the instructions for the sensors:

* [Microsoft Band 2](https://github.com/BioStack/Sensors101/blob/master/Sensors/Band2.md)
* [Touch Mouse](https://github.com/BioStack/Sensors101/blob/master/Sensors/TouchMouse.md)
* [Neurosky Mindwave EEG](https://github.com/BioStack/Sensors101/blob/master/Sensors/MindWave-EEG.md)
* [Eyetracking Tobi]() <- Andy instructions needed.
* [Zephyr](https://github.com/BioStack/Sensors101/blob/master/Sensors/Zephyr.md)
